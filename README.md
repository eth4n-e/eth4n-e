- 👋 Hi, I’m @eth4n-e
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, AI art, machine learning, video game development, music, film, animation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, I don't have much experience but I'm open to to new things
- 📫 How to reach me etep9497@colorado.edu

I'm a first year student at the University of Colorado Boulder majoring in Computer Science so hopefully in a couple of years I'll be of more help and service to the GitHub community
and hopefully I'll make some pretty cool stuff myself for any of you to interact with.

That's all for now.
